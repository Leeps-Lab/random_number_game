The instructions are simple, and if you follow them carefully, you can earn a considerable
amount of money. All the money you earn is yours to keep, and will be paid to you, in cash,
immediately after the study ends. You will be paid 13,000 MNT for participating and 15,000
MNT for completing the study. This study has three stages, and one of the three stages will be
randomly selected for you to earn additional money on top of the aforementioned 13,000 and
15,000 MNT. Read carefully the instruction on how you can earn money and raise your hand if
you have any questions.

Stage 1: Piece-rate payment

Your task in Stage 1 is to complete as many typing-exercises as possible. To be more precise, the
computer will present an image with the numbers of 1 to 9 in a random order and you will have
to type the numbers in the exact order in the box below the image. You will have 3 minutes time
to type as many exercises as possible. You enter an answer by clicking the “Confirm” button.
When you enter an answer, you immediately find out on the screen whether or not you typed
them correctly. If Stage 1 is the stage selected for payment (among Stages 1-3), then you will
receive 1,500 MNT for each correct answer that you entered within the 3 minutes. Your payment
is not reduced when you enter a wrong answer. Directly before the start of this stage you will be
given one minute in order to familiarize yourselves with the screen: During this time, you can
practice the typing exercise, which do not count for your earning. Afterwards, Stage 1 will begin.

Stage 2: Tournament payment

As in stage 1, you will again have 3 minutes time to type as many exercises as possible.
However, your payment in this stage depends on your performance relative to the performance
of a group of participants.
Group composition: Each group consists of 4 participants, 2 of whom are men and 2 are women.
Groups are randomly formed at the beginning of this stage and each participant stays in the same
group until the end of this part of the study. If Stage 2 is the stage selected for payment (amongst
Stages 1-3), then your payment depends on how many correct answers you had for the typing
exercise in this stage in comparison with the other three participants in your group. The group
member who has entered the most correct answers is the winner of the tournament. The winner
receives 6,000 MNT per correct answer each, while the other three members do not receive any
payment. In case of a tie, the ranking among the members with equal performances is determined
randomly. You will not be informed about the outcome of the tournament until the end of the
study.

Stage 3: Choice between Piece rate payment and Tournament payment

As in Stages 1 and 2, you will again have 3 minutes to type as many exercises as possible.
However, you must now choose your preferred payment method for your performance in Stage
3. You can either choose a Piece-rate payment (as in Stage 1) or a Tournament payment (as in
Stage 2). If you choose the Piece rate payment, then you will receive 1,500MNT per correct
answer. If you choose the Tournament payment, then your performance in Stage 3 will be
evaluated in comparison to the performance of the other three group members in Stage 2. 
As a reminder: That is the stage that you have just completed. If you enter more correct answers than
all three of your group members did in Stage 2, then you will receive 6,000MNT per correct
answer. In other words, no group member of your group can have a Stage 2-performance which
is higher than your Stage 3-performance, otherwise you receive no payment for this stage. In
case of a tie, the ranking among the members with equal performances is again determined
randomly. The group composition (with 2 men and 2 women) is as it was in Stage 2. If you
choose the Tournament payment, you will not be informed about the outcome of the tournament
until the end of the experiment</p>
